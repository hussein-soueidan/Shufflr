# Flutter Shufflr

This directory contains a minimal Flutter implementation of the Shufflr file management app.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter SDK.
2. Run `flutter pub get` in this directory to install dependencies.
3. Launch the app with `flutter run`.

The app currently allows selecting multiple files using `file_picker` and lists them on screen. Additional file management and renaming features can be implemented following this foundation.
